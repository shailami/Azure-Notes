Azure Stack - software driven component for creating private cloud on premise
3 top cloud public service providers
1.AWS
2.AZURE
3.GOOGLE


characteristics of cc
on demand
self service
broad network access
resource pooling
rapid elasticity
measured service

adv of cc
access to broad raange of managed services
minimized or eliminated capital expanses
usage-based billing model
improved agility


opex-hiring ppl for say maintainence ,blah blah etc 


cc-models
public -Infrastruct,platform,application service will be provided by service provider for access and consumption
private-privately,owned,managed cloud that offers benefits similar to public but is designed and secured for use by a single organization. 
hybrid - binds two separate clouds public and private cloud together for specific purpose of obtaining resources from both.(COLO -COLOCATION)

Virtualization 

team A -heavy task in terms of data read write operation like transactions and will require 15 days
team B -medium data read write and 10 day task
team C-very less task 3 days


3 machines
2cores and 4 GB Ram and everyone has 20GB of hard disk for each machine 

machine 1
machine 2 
machine 3 
if we assign 1 machine to each team 
underutilization of infrastructure 

if we combine all 3 machines the total capacity is trippled

now we have 6 cores 12GB Ram 60GB hard disk
 we can give 3 cores to team A ,2 cores to B ,1 core to Team C

this is possible with VIRTUALIZATION LAYER 


Companies like IBM ,VMVare,HP,OpenStack-providing sw which supports virtualization

Hyper-V is the virtualization layer Microsoft is providing to expose their services to world .


Azure Regions :
features of choosing regions:
4 important things:

1)Customers Availability:
if maximum customers are in europe and server is in India latency in terms of responding will be more
hence majority customer base location is imp to consider 
2)Service LifeCycle
Preview(beta version given to testers to test proper working) to -> GA(GENERAL Availability i.e. accessible 
to everyone )
if application in preview is given in producion environment it may contain some bugs 
hence preview must be in non-production env
so not all services are available in all regions depending on how is the success ratio of that service
3)Compliance (terms and conditions defined by local government body or industry u r targeting)
4)Cost : every region has diff tax,underneath infrastruct cost is different in different regions 



Available regions:which are available
Announced Regions:which are coming up

Availability Zones provided: multiple zones possible in one region

suppose in Region America
we have 2 data centers
so they are 2 zones 
if incase 1 data center is down 
we have another zone available.
so minimum 2 zone must be available in 1 regions.
